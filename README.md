## How to Run

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have a recent version of Python installed (3.13.9 is what I used in my testing).

Ensure the following dependencies are installed in your Python environment:

- matplotlib (for plotting)
- numpy (for array operations)
- scipy (for integration)
- numba (for vectorization)
- math (for exp() and log())

To run the SIR example, run the following command: `python SIR_example.py`

To run the simulation, run the following command: `python final_project.py`
